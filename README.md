# Another Crab's Quality of Life
A mod that adds several features that do in fact improve the quality of life.
## Features
- Skips the Pre-Title and Auto Starts your most recently played file.
- Shell and Shell Hammer health both regenerate upon entering and leaving a Moon Snail Shell, much like your normal health.
- Crystal Map Tracker
- Item Map Tracker
- (WIP) Config Menu

## Notes on WIP Features
I'm probably gonna add a really basic config menu next patch that will allow you to disable certain features as I add them, but I'm trying to work out how to hijack the actual menu to add ModSettings
